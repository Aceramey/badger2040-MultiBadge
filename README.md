# badger2040-MultiBadge
This is the code I use on my badger 2040 name tag
You will need thonny to edit the script and also to upload files/images onto the badger
Make sure to edit the file before using it, I have left two examples of how to use my draw function in the button function, along with comments explaining different parts of the script, also to use images, just copy them into the root directory of the badger

Enjoy :)
